  Description:
    Abstract:
      The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

      "This data set, part of the Watershed Boundary data set (WBD), is a complete digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subbasin (8-digit) 4th level for the entire United States. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated Attributes created in accordance with the "Federal Guidelines, Requirements, and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary data set; Chapter 3 of Section A, Federal Standards, Book 11, Collection and Delineation of Spatial Data; Techniques and Methods 11-A3" (04/01/2009). http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/data sets/watershed/index.html. Polygons are Attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 1st (Region), 2nd (Sub-Region), 3rd (Basin), and 4th (Sub-Basin) Hydrologic Unit Level codes, names, Sub-Basin acres and square miles."

    Purpose:
      The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

      "The Basin and Subbasin hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The largest sized 4th level subbasins are useful for numerous application programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information."

    Supplemental_Information:
      These metadata are a revision of a metadata file named "WBDHU8_09Jul2010.gdb metadata" published on September 23, 2009, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Cartography and Geospatial Center, for a polygon feature class in the geodatabase entitled "WBDHU8_09Jul2010.gdb."

    "The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the U.S.A. The NRCS should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The Watershed Boundary data set is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application of the data. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions they make.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data.  If enlarged, the maps will not include the fine detail that would be appropriate for mapping at the small scale.  Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data from the source distributor."

  Data_Set_Credit:
    Funding and support for the Watershed Boundary data set (WBD) were provided by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Geological Survey. Representatives from the U.S. Geological Survey and Environmental Protection Agency contributed a substantial amount of time and salary towards quality review and updating of the data set in order to meet the Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries.

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:

      The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

      "Attribute:Accuracy Report:  10% of the Attributes were visually reviewed.  The accuracy of this data is dependent on the level of detail of the source material and the interpretation procedures for capturing that source."

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

    "There are no unclosed polygons, intersections without nodes, or polygons without labels or with more than one label.  The ArcGIS geodatabase topology tools were used to make corrections using two rules: no gaps and no overlaps."

  Completeness_Report:
    The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

    "All fields for all polygons are attributed."

    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

        "The WBD was produced using Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) as the source map. Data completeness for DRG files reflects content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in the completeness and accuracy of the WBD. The map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale digital raster graphic base maps, with an inherited error of +/- 40 feet according to the USGS National Map Accuracy Standards.
        It is estimated that any errors detected were less than 10%. It should also be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used (i.e. natural water flow is downhill), the locations of boundaries are still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale DRGs do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries."

      Process_Description: Original data set attribution was reviewed and revised to reflect the updates and changes made to the data set. These revisions to the attribution were also made to ensure that the data set met the Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries. The NHD was used during this process to help with the naming and downstream coding of each unit. In some instances there were name hydrologic unit name discrepancies between the NHD and what was printed on the DRGs. In these instances the DRGs were used instead of the NHD.

    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Each hydrologic unit polygon has associated attributes stored in tabular format. An attribute, also called a field or column, is defined by
      name, type, size, and valid values. For this layer, these attributes are the Hydrologic Unit Codes, Names, Acreage, Square Miles, States, and FIPS code for each county boundary crossed. <ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NCGC/products/watershed/hu-standards.pdf>.

    "The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the U.S.A.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture makes no claims for the suitability of the data for other purposes. U.S. Department of Agriculture should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The Watershed Boundary data set is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application of the data. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions they make.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data.
