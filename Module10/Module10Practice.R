######Three-year crime data from 2017-09-01 to 2020-08-31
crime_bat <- readRDS("Crime3years.rds")
## Select two-years
bat_train <- head(crime_bat, 365*24*2)

#Basic time series based on scatter plot
bat_train %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Battery)) +
  geom_point(col = "maroon") + 
  geom_line(col = "red") +
  labs(title = "Battery Crime from 2017-09-01 to 2019-08-31 in Chicago", 
       x = "Hourly", y = "Number of Crimes") 


##Create new variables
bat_train_new<-bat_train %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(bat_train$Date),week= weekdays(bat_train$Date),  
         month = month(bat_train$Date),year=year(bat_train$Date)) %>% 
  mutate(weeknum= strftime(Date, format = '%V')) 


#How to group the data into weekly (every 7 days) data
bat_train_weekly <- bat_train_new %>% 
  group_by(weeknum,year) %>%
  summarize(case_weekly=sum(Battery)) %>%
  mutate(yearweek=paste0(year,weeknum))


#####First try for graphing
bat_train_weekly%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = yearweek, y = case_weekly,group=1)) +
  geom_point(col = "maroon") + geom_line(col = "red") +
  labs(title = "Battery Crime from 2017-09-01 to 2019-08-31 in Chicago", 
       x = "Week", y = "Number of Crimes") 

#########The best result
bat_train_weekly%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = yearweek, y = case_weekly,group=1)) +
  geom_point(col = "maroon") + geom_line(col = "red") +
  labs(title = "Battery Crime from 2017-09-01 to 2019-08-31 in Chicago",

                                max(bat_train_weekly$yearweek),
                                10))
