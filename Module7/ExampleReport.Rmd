# 1. How to emebed image into R Markdnow

This is an example of embedding images in your local folder into R Markdown.
For example, I have a illustration graph of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra under the folder 7.1. 

![Schematic illustration of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra.](C:/Users/ali3/OneDrive - Ball State University/Desktop/Courses/Coursera/DSCI605/Week7/7.1/Schematic illustration of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra.png)

This is another way to insert the image and set the position for the image.

```{r rein0, include = TRUE,fig.align = 'center', out.width = "25%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:rein0}Resized Schematic illustration of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra"}

knitr::include_graphics("Schematic illustration of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra.png")
```

# 2. Create a high quality figure in R Markdown

This is an example of plotting graphs by setting the plotting area and resolution.
For example, I create a histogram below and set the width, height and resolution in the Chunk options. You can also define the figure size in YAML header and/or define the figure size as global chunk option.

```{r figs1,fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.res=200,fig.cap="\\label{fig:figs1}A basic histogram of the incomes"}

library(ggplot2)
df <- read.csv("Income by states.csv")
#plot the basic histogram
ggplot(df, aes(x=income)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=10000,color="black", fill="blue")

```

# 3. Refer to the figure by indexing the figure.

In Figure \ref{fig:figs1}, we see that the distribution of incomes is close to a normal distribution.
In Figure \ref{fig:rein0}, we see the illustration graph.


# 4. Create tables using the kable function from the knitr package.

kable takes a data.frame as input, and outputs the table into a markdown table, which will get rendered into the appropriate output format.

For example, letâ€™s say we wanted to share the first 6 rows of our mtcars data.

This gives us the following output:
```{r tabl,include=TRUE}
top_mtcars <- head(mtcars)

knitr::kable(top_mtcars,caption= "A Knitr's kable to show the first six rows of 'mtcars'",digits=2)

```
# 5. Refer to the tables


For example, letâ€™s say we wanted to share the first 10 rows of our mtcars data.

This gives us the following output:
```{r tabl1,include=TRUE}
top_mtcars <- head(mtcars,10)

knitr::kable(top_mtcars,caption= "A Knitr's kable to show the first ten rows of 'mtcars'",digits=2)

```

In Table \ref{tab:tbl1}, we see the first **10** rows  of the dataset "mtcars".
