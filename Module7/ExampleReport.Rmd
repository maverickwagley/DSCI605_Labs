# 1. How to emebed image into R Markdnow

This is an example of embedding images in your local folder into R Markdown.
For example, I have a illustration graph of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra under the folder 7.1. 

![Histogram_png](C:/Users/maver/OneDrive/Documents/School/DS605/DSCI605_Labs/Module7/Histogram_png.png)

This is another way to insert the image and set the position for the image.

```{r rein0, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:rein0}Resized Histogram_png"}

knitr::include_graphics("Histogram_png.png")
```
